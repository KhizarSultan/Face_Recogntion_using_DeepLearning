# Face_Recogntion_using_DeepLearning
This project will solve the problem to manually mark attendance of the students using Deep Learning. In this project, We did detect face 
and then compute 128-d embedding vector of face and then apply Random Forest Machine Learning to train the model and got 97 % accuracy
and finally recognize the faces in images and in video. if you have any query or question related to this project, you can email me at 
khizersultan007@gmail.com without any hesitation.
Happy Learning.
