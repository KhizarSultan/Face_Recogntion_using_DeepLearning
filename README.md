# Face_Recogntion_using_DeepLearning
This project will solve the problem to manually mark attendance of the students using Deep Learning. In this project, We did detect faces  and then compute 128-d embedding vector of faces and then apply Random Forest Machine Learning Algorithm to train the model and got 97 % accuracy and finally recognize the faces in images and in video.
